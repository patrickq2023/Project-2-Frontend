    <p class="intro">For many cyclists, there is something deeply alluring about riding in the mountains. It’s difficult to pinpoint 
      precisely why climbing mountains on a bike tends to call so loudly, but there are lots of possible draws. 
      Whether it is the challenge they represent, the personal test, the dramatic scenery and panoramas you encounter,
       or the sense of achievement when you make it to the summit. The very act of climbing on a bike can somehow provide
        solace – you’re in a rhythm, a zone, it’s difficult to think about day to day worries and concerns, you are free.
        <br>
      This list is very short and there are literally hundreds that could have been included, but these particular ones 
      all have that magic appeal that make you want to get on a plane and go tick off a few more.</p>
